RNA quantity was measured using Qubit® 4.0 fluorometer and quality were analyzed by using 1% agarose gel.Preparation of LibraryThe paired-end sequencing library was prepared using KAPA mRNA HyperPrep Kit for Illumina. (CAT #KK8581). The library preparation process was initiated with 500-1000 ng input. mRNA enrichment was performed as per user manual and mRNA was subjected to fragmentation, first &amp; second-strand cDNA synthesis, end-repair, 3´ adenylating, adapter ligation, selective enrichment of adapter-ligated DNA fragments through PCR amplification, followed by validation of Library on Agilent 4150 tape station. The final library was pooled with other-samples, denatured &amp; loaded on to flow cell. On the flow cell, cluster generation &amp; sequencing was performed using Illumina Novaseq X plus platform to generate 2×150bp paired-end (PE) readQuantity and quality check (QC) of library on Agilent Tape Station 4150The amplified libraries were analyzed on TapeStation 4150 (Agilent Technologies) using High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape® as per manufacturer's instructions.Cluster Generation and SequencingAfter obtaining the Qubit concentration for the library and the mean peak size from Tape Station profile, library will be loaded onto illumine Novaseq X Plus for cluster generation and sequencing. Paired-End sequencing allows the template fragments to be sequenced in both the forward and reverse directions. The library molecules will bind to complementary adapter oligos on paired-end flow cell. The adapters are designed to allow selective cleavage of the forward strands after re-synthesis of the reverse strand during sequencing. The copied reverse strand is then used to sequence from the opposite end of the fragment.Results: RNA QC on 1% agarose gel1Lane idSample name1PM DROUGHT2PM DROUGHT3PM CONTROL4PM CONTROLQuantification using Qubit 4.0 FluorometerS.

Clean reads thus produced were used for analysis. Reference guided transcript assembly was performed for samples first by mapping clean reads on reference genome using STAR (v2.7.10a) aligner and then performing transcript assembly by StringTie (v 2.2.1). A consensus set of transcripts was obtained using SringTie merge function which merges together all the gene structures found in any of the samples. Transcript abundance was then estimated for individual sample using merged transcript consensus again using StringTie and read counts thus obtained for each transcript were taken as input for differential expression analysis using edgeR package. Gene Ontology and pathway analysis of the significantly differentially expressed transcripts were performed using Blast2go cli and KEGG-KAAS server respectively. Overall bioinformatics workflow is graphically represented in figure above and software version along with its use in table below.Detail of Software used for analysisSoftwareVersionApplicationTrim Galore0.6.4Adapter and low-quality data removalSTAR2.7.10Mapping of reads to reference genomeStringtie2.2.1Reference based assemblygffcompare0.12.6Comparing reference genome gff with merged gff file generated from stringtiegffread0.12.7Fetching fasta sequences corresponding to gff file generated after reference-based assembly by stringtieBlastx2.30.0+Similarity search against NCBI NR databaseBlast2go cli1.5GO mapping and annotationedgeR3.6.2Differential expression analysis and its visualizationKEGG KAASWebserverPathway analysisclusterProfiler4.12.6Over-representation (or enrichment) analysisData statisticsThe next generation sequencing for these samples were performed on the Illumina1: Data statisticsSampleReads in R1Reads in R2Total Reads(R1+R2)Total Bases (R1+R2)Total Data(GB)PM-CONTROL-226290333262903335258066683603258948.36PM-CONTROL29586621295866215917324294085454789.41PM-DROUGHT-124372317243723174874463477503968067.75PM-DROUGHT24990814249908144998162879470788527.95“01_Raw_DataReference genome informationBased on information received from client, tPearl MilletGCF_000499845.2(https://cegresources.icrisat.org/data_public/PearlMillet_Genome/v1.1/).2: Reference genome statsDescriptionStatsTotal Chromosomes/Scaffolds7Total genome length (bp)1,564,537,551Mean chromosome/scaffold size223,505,364Max chromosome/scaffold size (bp)300,907,625Min chromosome/scaffolds size (bp)154,011,256"02_reference_genome_and_gff"3: Detail Information of GFF fileGenome elements# SequencesmRNA35791CDS147370Mapping to reference genomeIndexing of the reference genome was carried out using STAR genomeGenerate mode option. Then the input reads, in FASTQ format, along with the indexed reference genome generated in previous step was given to the STAR aligner. The analysis begins by mapping HQ reads against the reference genome to identify the positions from where the reads originated. This mapping information allows us to collect subsets of the reads corresponding to each gene, and then to assemble and quantify transcripts represented by those reads. Hence, the high-quality reads were mapped to reference genome using STAR aligner to create alignment in BAM format for each sample with default parameters. The mapping statistics are provided in the table below:4: Mapping StatisticsSample NameTotal clean ReadsNo. of Mapped Reads% of mapped read# uniquely mapped reads% uniquely mapped readsPM-CONTROL295274262571944987.102490494784.35PM-CONTROL-2262300262307533987.972235610785.23PM-DROUGHT249347362186450387.692116725184.89PM-DROUGHT-1243179982124647687.372057582884.61Transcript assemblypartial versions of them will be assembled in the initial StringTie run. The merge step creates a set of transcripts that is consistent across all samples, so that the transcripts can be compared in subsequent steps in figure below:7: Explanation of merging transcript assemblies using StringTie’s merge function. In this example, four partial assemblies from four different samples are merged into two transcripts A and B. Samples 1 and 2 are both consistent with the reference annotation, which is used here to merge and extend them to create transcript A. Samples 3 and 4 are consistent with each other but not with the annotation, and these are merged to create transcript B. Please note that the 4 samples shown here are for example purpose only (Ref: Micheal P et al., 2016).The statistics of merged transcripts and individual transcript assembly is provided in the table below:5: Transcript assembly statisticsSample Name# assembled transcriptsTotal assembled (bp)Mean transcript size (bp)Max transcript size (bp)merged.fasta66,7589,29,31,8691,39215,558PM-CONTROL-245,7107,23,93,9521,583.8015,558PM-CONTROL45,7037,24,29,9771,584.8015,558PM-DROUGHT-145,8207,25,59,7581,583.6015,558PM-DROUGHT45,2887,17,22,4341,583.7015,558"03_transcript_assembly_gtf""04_transcript_sequences_fasta".Note: “MSTRG" in output files generated from stringtie stands for "Merged StringTie Transcripts," followed by a unique number. This identifier is created by StringTie merged step to label transcript isoforms that were not previously annotated in the reference genome used.Comparison of assembled transcripts with reference transcriptsFor comparison of assembled transcripts with reference transcripts, Gffcompare utility was run taking the reference GTF and the string-tie merged GTF file. This produces an output file, which adds to each transcript a "class code" and the name of the transcript from the reference annotation file to check how the predicted transcripts relate to an annotation file. Meaning of each class code is depicted in figure below:8: Different class codes and their descriptions(https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/gffcompare.shtml)Identification of novel isoform transcripts13,186"03_transcript_assembly_gff". A brief description of the column names in the GTF file is provided in the same folder in the file named ReadMe.txt.Differential expression analysisAbundances of the transcripts in all samples were estimated using StringTie with the help of merged transcripts generated from merge stringtie step. A python program (prepDE.py) was used to extract the read count information directly from the files generated by StringTie. For differential expression analysis, sample comparison was made according to grouping information provided by client:Comparison informationComparisonDescription(Control)Comparison 1 [Drought1 (PM-DROUGHT-1) Vs Control1 (PM-CONTROL)]Drought2 v/s Control2 (Control)Comparison 2 [Drought2 (PM-DROUGHT) Vs Control2 (PM-CONTROL-2)]Group wise sample information6: Sample descriptionGroup NameSample NameControl2PM-CONTROL-2Control1PM-CONTROLDrought1PM-DROUGHT-1Drought2PM-DROUGHTDifferential gene expression was inferred between samples by applying the R package edgeR It is Bioconductor package based on negative binomial distribution method.

However, as there are no replicates in this study, we performed DEG analysis using edgeR, which is capable of producing reasonable results in single-sample comparisons.MA Plot for differentially expressed genesThe plot visualizes the differences between measurements taken in two samples, by transforming the data onto M (log ratio) and A (mean average) scales, then plotting these values. For illustration purpose, MA plot for Comparison1 has been depicted below:9: MA plot showing differentially expressed transcripts in Comparison-1. On X-axis normalized counts for all the samples and on Y-axis log2foldchange are plotted. Points colored are with red if the q-value is less than 0.05 and black if the q-value is greater than 0.05.Volcano plot for differentially expressed genesThe "volcano plot" arranges expressed genes along dimensions of biological as well as statistical significance. For illustration purpose, Volcano plot for Comparison1 has been depicted below:10: Volcano plot showing differentially expressed transcripts in Comparison-1. X-axis represents the log2fold change values and Y-axis represents log10 of q-value (FDR corrected p-value. Points are colored red if the q-value is less than 0.05 and black if the q-value is greater than 0.05.Note: Volcano plot for only one comparison has been shown above, however plots for all other combinations has been provided as a part of data deliverables “05_differential_expression analysis”.Heatmap for significantly differential expressed genesList of transcripts were selected for heatmap generation based on following criteria:25 transcripts (downregulated) and 25 transcripts (upregulated) having lowest FDR/adjusted pvalueTranscripts must have proper annotations.pheatmap package from R software was used for producing heatmap. The colour coding ranges from red to blue where shades of red represent high transcripts expression and shades of blue represents low transcript expression.11: Heatmap representing most significant genes expressed in the samples was plotted using log10 of normalized read count values (CPM) for Comparison-1, where shades of blue represent downregulated genes and shades of red represents highly expressed genes.Note: Heatmap plot for only one comparison has been shown above, however plots for all other combinations have been provided as a part of data deliverables “05_differential_expression_analysis”.Gene Ontology (GO) analysis for significant DEGThe Gene Ontology project provides controlled vocabularies of defined terms representing gene product properties. These cover three domains: Cellular Component, the parts of a cell or its extracellular environment; Molecular Function, the elemental activities of a gene product at the molecular level, such as binding or catalysis; and Biological Process, operations or sets of molecular events with a defined beginning and end, pertinent to the functioning of integrated living units: cells, tissues, organs, and organisms. GO was assigned tosignificant differentially expressed transcripts using Blast2go cli. Single gene can be assigned with multiple GO categories and hence multiple GO terms.
